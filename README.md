🖥️ How the System Works

User selects matrix dimensions (rows & columns).

Inputs values for Matrix A and Matrix B.

Chooses the desired operation.

Results are displayed instantly on the UI.

The same operations are implemented in C for algorithm understanding.

▶️ How to Run the Project
🔹 Run the UI

Download or clone the repository

Open index.html in any browser

Enter matrix values and perform operations

🔹 Run the C Program
gcc matrix.c -o matrix
./matrix
